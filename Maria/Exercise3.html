    <p>
        <span>Father did you miss me,
        Been locked up a while.
        I got caught for what I did but took it all in style.
        Laid to rest all my confessions I gave way back when.
        Now I'm versed in so much worse,
        So I am back again, and he said </span><br>
        <span>For the lives that I take, I'm going to hell! </span> the love that I make, I'm going to hell! Gettin' heavy with the devil, you can hear the wedding bells. Father did you miss me,
        <span> Don't ask me where I've been. You know I know,
            yes, I've been told I redefine a sin. I don't know what's driving me to put this in my head. Maybe I wish I could die, maybe I am dead!</span>
        <span>And he said For the lives that I fake, I'm going to hell! </span> For the vows that I break, I'm going to hell! For the ways that I hurt, when I'm hiking up my skirt. I am sitting on a throne while they're buried in the dirt. For the man
        that I hate, I'm going to hell! Gettin' heavy with the devil, you can hear the wedding bells. Please forgive me father, I didn't mean to bother you. The devil's in me father. He's inside of everything I do.<br> For the lives that I take, I'm going
        to hell! For the laws that I break, I'm going to hell! For the love that I hate, I'm going to hell! For the lies that I make, I'm going to hell! For the way I condescend and never lend a hand. My arrogance is making this head buried in the sand.
        For the souls I forsake, I'm going to hell! Gettin' married to the devil, you can hear the wedding bells.
